Kaithon is a new programming language that was created for people that are just starting out and need something easy to learn. Has syntax from many different programming languages including Python,Java,Javascript and C.
At the moment, Kaithon is in only in alpha and has very low functionality. In the near future we hope to be able to make a wider range of features to a wider audience.
As Kaithon grows in functionality the syntax will get harder to understand. I am trying to keep the syntax as basic as possible by limiting use of quotation marks and parenthasies.
